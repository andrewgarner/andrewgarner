### Hey there 👋

I’m a senior software architect and engineer with broad experience of large‑scale web‑based application design, development, integration, hosting, testing, security and maintenance.

I’ve worked extensively in multidisciplinary product teams and have an excellent understanding of designing for user needs. I’m able to translate between a technical and non‑technical audience easily. I value empathy, communication and simplicity above all else.
