### Hey there 👋🏼

I’m a product‑minded technical leader with broad experience delivering resilient systems. I practise domain‑driven design and extreme programming. I am comfortable with ambiguity, owning challenging problems, and managing trade‑offs.

I enjoy continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and mentoring others. I enable teams to perform at their best by fostering collaboration and removing obstacles.

Above all, I value curiosity, empathy, and simplicity.
